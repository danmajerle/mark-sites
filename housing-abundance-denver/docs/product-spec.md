# Product Spec (MVP)

## Core UX
1. Hero with current totals
2. KPI strip:
   - total units in pipeline
   - affordable units in pipeline
   - projects count
   - units delivered YTD
3. Filterable table/list
4. Project detail drawer/page with source links

## Design Direction
- Minimalist, editorial, modern
- Lots of whitespace, restrained color
- Black/white/stone palette with one accent (electric blue)
- System font stack for speed

## Data Freshness
- Weekly refresh target
- Every row must include at least one source URL and update timestamp
