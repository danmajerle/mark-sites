## Suggested section structure

### 1) Section intro (short)
I build open source productivity tools that reduce busywork, tighten execution loops, and help teams move from idea to shipped output faster.

### 2) Tool cards (repeatable format)
For each tool:
- **Tool name**
- **One-line value prop**
- **Who it’s for**
- **Core use cases** (3 bullets)
- **Status** (active / beta / archived)
- **Links:** GitHub, docs, quick-start, demo video

### 3) “How I think about tools” block
A short paragraph on design principles:
- clear before clever
- opinionated defaults
- measurable time savings
- composable with existing workflows

### 4) CTA
- "Suggest a feature"

## Copy draft (ready to paste)
### Open Source Productivity Tools
I build and share open source tools that help people execute faster—less friction, fewer handoffs, shorter cycles from idea to result.

Most tools here start from a real operational bottleneck. If a workflow is repetitive, error-prone, or hard to scale, I try to make it simpler and more reliable in code.

Expect practical utilities, not science projects.
